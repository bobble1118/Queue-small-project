# Item Processing Simulation Program

## Overview

This program simulates the processing of items through different types of queues and processors. Each item has a unique ID, type, arrival time, and processing time. The program processes these items using a queue system, where each type of item is processed by a separate set of queues and processors. It generates detailed logs of the processing, including the state of each queue and processor over time.

## Features

1. **Item Structure**: Defines the properties of each item, including its ID, type, arrival time, processing time, and completion time.
2. **Queue System**: Implements a queue system to manage the processing of items by different types.
3. **Data Generation**: Can generate random item data for testing purposes.
4. **File Handling**: Reads input data from a file and outputs the processing results to another file.
5. **Simulation**: Simulates the processing of items through the queue system, managing multiple queues for different item types.
6. **Queue Management**: Supports creating, enqueuing, dequeuing, and destroying queues.
7. **Memory Management**: Properly allocates and frees memory for dynamic data structures.

## How It Works

1. **Input Data**: The program reads the item data from an input file. Each item has an ID, type, arrival time, and processing time.
2. **Queue Initialization**: Initializes queues for each item type, with user-specified numbers of queues for each type.
3. **Processing Simulation**: Simulates the arrival and processing of items. Items are enqueued based on their arrival times and processed by the least occupied queue.
4. **Output Results**: Generates output logs showing the processing of items, including their arrival, processing start, and completion times.
5. **Memory Cleanup**: After processing, the program frees all dynamically allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.

## Usage

### Compilation

Compile the program using a C compiler, such as `gcc`:

```bash
gcc -o item_processing_simulation program.c
```

### Running the Program

Run the compiled program:

```bash
./item_processing_simulation
```

The program will prompt you to enter the name of the input file containing the item data.

### Input File Format

The input file should contain the item data in the following format:

```
item_id type arrtime processtime
```

- `item_id`: A unique identifier for the item.
- `type`: The type of the item (1, 2, or 3).
- `arrtime`: The arrival time of the item.
- `processtime`: The time required to process the item.

### Program Flow

1. **File Input**: Reads the input file specified by the user.
2. **Data Handling**: Counts the number of items for each type and initializes the queue system.
3. **Processing**: Processes items based on their arrival time and processing time, using a priority queue system.
4. **Output Generation**: Outputs the results to a new file named after the input file with `_output.txt` appended.
5. **Memory Cleanup**: Destroys all queues and frees allocated memory.

### Example

If the input file is named `input.txt`, the program will generate an output file named `input_output.txt` with the processing details.

## Functions

### Main Functions

- `main()`: The entry point of the program. Handles file input, initializes queues, starts the processing simulation, and cleans up memory.
- `process()`: Simulates the processing of items through the queue system.
- `data_generator()`: Generates random item data for testing purposes.
- `ReadFile()`: Reads item data from a file and organizes it into a linked list.
- `Find_output_name()`: Creates and returns a file pointer for the output file.
- `countTypes()`: Counts the number of items for each type.
- `get_Q_num_eachtype()`: Prompts the user to enter the number of queues for each type.

### Queue Management

- `CreateQ()`: Creates the queue system for each item type.
- `enQ()`: Enqueues items into the appropriate queue based on their arrival time.
- `deQ()`: Dequeues items from the queue for processing.
- `emptyQ()`: Checks if a queue is empty.
- `find_least_item_Q()`: Finds the queue with the least number of items.
- `Destroy_Q()`: Destroys the queue system and frees memory.
- `Destroy_typelist()`: Frees memory for the item lists.

### File Handling

- `checkFileExistence()`: Checks if the input file exists.
- `handleExistingFile()`, `handleNewFile()`: Handle file operations for existing and new files.

## Notes

- The program uses dynamic memory allocation for managing items and queues. Ensure that the system has sufficient memory to handle the required number of items and queues.
- Make sure the input file follows the specified format for correct processing.
- The maximum number of items (`idmax`) is set to 1000. Adjust this value in the code if needed.

## Future Improvements

- Add error handling for file operations and user inputs.
- Allow the simulation parameters to be set via command-line arguments.
- Implement more complex processing rules or item types.
